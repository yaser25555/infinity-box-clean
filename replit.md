## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via LoginForm/RegisterForm

3. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT token
4. Token stored locally and used for subsequent API requests
5. Auto-logout on token expiration or manual logout

### Game Integration Flow
1. User selects game from GameGrid component
2. Game launches in new window/tab with authentication context
3. Game communicates with backend for score updates
4. Progress synced back to main dashboard

### Real-time Communication Flow
1. WebSocket connection established on authentication
2. User joins default voice room
3. Real-time events broadcast to all connected clients
4. Message and user state synchronization across clients
